# DIGITAL-DREAMERS- Spam SMS Detection

## Project Overview
 A machine learning-based model to classfiy SMS messages as spam or legitimate using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Spam 
 messages are a common issue, often leading to scams and phishing. The project aims to **build an AI model** tha can accurately detect spam 
 messages using **TF-IDF, worf embeddings, and classfiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM**.
